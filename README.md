# Python Notes
This repository is designed to provide you with comprehensive notes and examples for learning Python programming. Whether you are a beginner getting started with Python or an experienced developer looking to refresh your knowledge, this repository is here to support your learning journey.

# Day 1: Introduction to Python and Variables
Day 1 covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming. In this session, you will learn about variables, data types, and basic string manipulation. The code examples provided demonstrate how to assign variables, perform type checking, and work with strings. Additionally, the concept of multiple variable assignment and accessing elements through slicing is explained. You will also explore various string methods for modifying and manipulating strings.

## Topics covered in Day 1:

- Introduction to Python and variables
* Variable assignment and type checking
+ Case sensitivity of variables
- Variable naming conventions
* Multiple variable assignment
+ Accessing elements through slicing
- String manipulation and methods

# Day 2: Lists and Operators
Day 2 focuses on lists, one of the fundamental data types in Python, and introduces operators used in Python programming. You will learn how to create and manipulate lists, iterate over list elements, and access list elements through indexing and slicing. The concept of shallow copy is also explained, highlighting its behavior when modifying list elements. Additionally, you will explore various operators such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators.
## Topics covered in Day 2:

- Topics covered in Day 2:
* Lists in Python
+ Iterating over list elements
- Checking list membership
* Using indexing and slicing with lists
+ Shallow copy of lists
- Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
+ Comparison operators
- Logical operators

In the provided code examples, you will find explanations and demonstrations of each topic. Uncommenting the code snippets will allow you to observe the behavior and results of different operations and concepts covered in Day 2.

## Throughout this repository, each day's content will build upon the previous days, gradually expanding your Python knowledge and skills. Be sure to follow along sequentially to make the most of your learning experience.
